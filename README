The quickest way to generate files is to do:
./generate.sh

However, this most likely will not give you what you're looking for when
creating packages.

Instead first do:
./setup.sh

Secondly, you will probably want to run ./generate.rb manually and specify
options.  Run ./generate.rb -h for more help.
